Some of the ideas to incorporate in here to make it more fun are as follows:
1.Power-ups - This appear randomly on the board and have special effects such as they could allow the user to swap two cells without penalty or add bonus points to the score.
2.Obstacles - They block cells and make the game more challenging. 
3.Different game modes - Where one mode could be to clear the board by making all cells the same number, while another mode could be to reach a certain score within a limited number of moves.
4.Multiplayer - Where two players can compete against each other on the same board in which each player takes turns making moves and the player with the highest score at the end wins.

Lastly, 5.Customizable rules - Allow the user to customize the rules of the game such as number of moves allowed, size of board , types of power-ups , obstacles and the scoring system.

Various ways to add depth and variety to the gameplay:
1. Multi-level gameplay - multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Each level could have a different board layout, different rules, or different power-ups and obstacles.
2.Time limit: add a time limit to the game, and require the user to complete as many moves as possible within the allotted time. This adds a sense of urgency and challenge to the game.
3.Special cells: add special cells that have different properties. For example, a cell could be a bomb that explodes when swapped, causing nearby cells to be destroyed. Another cell could be a bonus cell that gives the user extra points when swapped.
4.Combo system: add a combo system that rewards the user for making multiple swaps in a row. For example, if the user makes three or more swaps in a row, they could earn bonus points or power-ups.
5.Daily challenges: add daily challenges that provide the user with a unique board layout and specific objectives to complete. This encourages the user to come back and play the game on a regular basis.
6.Achievements and rewards: add achievements and rewards that give the user a sense of progress and accomplishment. For example, the user could earn badges for completing certain objectives or reaching certain milestones.
7.Social features: add social features that allow the user to compete against friends or other players. For example, the user could challenge their friends to beat their high score, or join a leaderboard to see how they rank against other players.
